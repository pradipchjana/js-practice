A word will be shown, you have to remember it and type it.

## level 1 Finger-Twisters (The "Adjacent" Challenge)
These words force your fingers to rapidly use adjacent keys, which breaks 
the flow of standard touch-typing and leads to errors under pressure.

Word	|Length|	QWERTY Challenge
PULSARS	| 7	|Jump between home row and top row (S to A jump)
DIAPHRAGM|	10	|The PHR and GM clusters are very awkward.
SWERVING|	8	|Many keys typed by the left hand's index finger in succession.
TREASURE|	8	|Awkward ASU pattern.
ZEALOUS|	7	|Rare Z key use at the start.
